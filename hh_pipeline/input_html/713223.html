・ I applied for the data Scientist position in the Google Cloud Revenue Acceleration Team. I was referred by a friend and the whole process took about 4 weeks. <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ Phase 1: Discussion with the Recruiter I interviewed for the same role one year ago. I didn't get through and the recruiter at that time refused to provide any specific feedback stating that they were not allowed to share. However, when I reapplied, the recruiter was very helpful and basically walked me through an "approximate" feedback of how I did last time and what went wrong. <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ First technical screen (telephonic): I skipped this part. <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ General Cognitive Ability: This interview focused on business case study like questions (2) and lasted 45 minutes. The idea was to <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ 1. Understand the question and the context quickly <font class="jammer"></font><div id="1p3a-ad-thread-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div><br>
・ 2. Come up with a structured approach towards the solution <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ 3. Discuss the questions posed by the interviewer in the middle of the conversation Overall, preparing for the business case interviews helped me for this interview. The interviewer generally focused and asked questions about the technical aspects of the problem and most of the discussion after coming up with the structure was technical in nature (e.g. What are some ways to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data? Which models you will pick to answer this (classification) problem and why ? Compare the approach with others etc.) <font class="jammer">-baidu 1point3acres</font><br>
・ Technical Round (Stats and ML, 45 minutes): This was relatively easy I would say. The interviewer asked to code a simple problem related to string manipulation and percentile calculation. On the ML bit, most discussion hovered around MLE concepts, CI and Hypothesis testing basics. Overall, not very difficult and the interviewer was very helpful. <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ Leadership (45 minutes): In this round , interviewer focused on questions related to leadership experiences in the past and asked for examples showcasing initiative, handling conflicts and pushing / advocating for ideas. The questions were very open ended and the interviewer was very helpful. I suggest writing down 10-15 behavioral questions in advance for practice (which I didn't do). <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ Googlyness (45 minutes): This was simply a rehash of Leadership type questions. The interviewer came prepared with 7-8 classic behavior interview questions and asked them one after the other. By the end I was very tired and I suspect this is the interview which DQed me.<font class="jammer"></font><br>

・ Basic MLE, CI and Hypothesis testing. Know it cold.<font class="jammer"></font><br>
