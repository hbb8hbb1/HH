First technical screen (telephonic)<font class="jammer"></font><br>
General Cognitive Ability: This interview focused on business case study like questions (2) and lasted 45 minutes. The idea was to <font class="jammer"></font><br>
・ 1. Understand the question and the context quickly <font class="jammer"></font><div id="1p3a-ad-thread-paragraph" style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 20px;"></div><br>
・ 2. Come up with a structured approach towards the solution <font class="jammer"></font><br>

<div style="border: 1px solid #C2D5E3;padding:8px 8px 8px 24px;">・ 3. Discuss the questions posed by the interviewer in the middle of the conversation Overall, preparing for the business case interviews helped me for this interview. The interviewer generally focused and asked questions about the technical aspects of the problem and most of the discussion after coming up with the structure was technical in nature (e.g. What are some ways to effectively reduce the dimensionality of the data? Which models you will pick to answer this (classification) problem and why ? Compare the approach with others etc.) <font class="jammer"></font><br>
Technical Round (Stats and ML, 45 minutes): This was relatively easy I would say. The interviewer asked to code a simple problem related to string manipulation and percentile calculation. On the ML bit, most discussion hovered around MLE concepts, CI and Hypothesis testing basics. Overall, not very difficult and the interviewer was very helpful. <font class="jammer"></font><br>
Leadership (45 minutes): In this round , interviewer focused on questions related to leadership experiences in the past and asked for examples showcasing initiative, handling conflicts and pushing / advocating for ideas. The questions were very open ended and the interviewer was very helpful. I suggest writing down 10-15 behavioral questions in advance for practice (which I didn't do).<font class="jammer"></font><br>
Googlyness (45 minutes): This was simply a rehash of Leadership type questions. The interviewer came prepared with 7-8 classic behavior interview questions and asked them one after the other. By the end I was very tired and I suspect this is the interview which DQed me.<font class="jammer"></font><br>
