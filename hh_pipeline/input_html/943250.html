感觉很经典的两道题目！<font class="jammer"></font><br />
<strong>1、Testing Price Increase</strong><font class="jammer"></font><br />
Let’s say that you work at a B2B SAAS company that’s interested in testing the pricing of different levels of subscriptions.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Your project manager comes to you and asks you to run a two-week-long A/B test to test an increase in pricing.<br />
<span style="display:none"></span>How would you approach designing this test? How would you determine whether the increase in pricing is a good business decision?<br />
<span style="display:none"></span>Let’s tackle one overarching question first - should we run an A/B test when testing pricing?<font class="jammer">. Χ</font><br />
<font class="jammer"></font><br />
answers：A/B testing pricing generally has more downsides than upsides. One major downside is that if two users go to a pricing page and one of them sees a product for \$50$50/month and the other sees one for \$25$25/month, you’re risking an incentive for your users to opt-out of your A/B test into another bucket, creating real statistical anomalies.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
But an even larger issue on A/B testing pricing is on understanding success? If you’re testing a discount rate on a subscription product - you want to know two things:<font class="jammer"></font><br />
1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does the customer convert at a higher rate for the discount?<font class="jammer"></font><br />
2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Is the total lifetime value of the customer higher as well?<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Running a recurring revenue A/B test means a pricing test must run for at least 2+ months. One month for all of the users to opt-in, the second month to examine the churn rate for all of those initial users.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Instead, generally, the most optimal way to test pricing is to do before and after tests. Measuring two periods of time that are similar in many ways, to understand the life expectancy and behavior of your customers. Of course, if you continue to launch features during this time, it’ll introduce bias. But there aren’t many ways around this.<br />
<span style="display:none">.1point3acres</span>The biggest pitfall of testing pricing is almost always the overhead in doing so. Test pricing can be a precarious thing, where customer support, product managers, marketing, and everyone has to be bought into the launch and change.<font class="jammer">. From 1point 3acres bbs</font><br />
Therefore the future of testing pricing will many times be dependent on how a company figures out to lower the overhead in the testing process. Continuously switching your prices every month may confuse your customers in addition to your team, which results in not a straightforward approach towards each launch.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
In the future, if you can reduce the overhead required to iterate on multiple tests by creating a coordinated process to test pricing, you may be able to bring the highest value of revenue return in the least amount of work.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
<font class="jammer"></font><br />
<strong>2、Button AB Test</strong><font class="jammer"></font><br />
A team wants to A/B test multiple different changes through a sign-up funnel.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
For example, on a page, a button is currently red and at the top of the page. They want to see if changing a button from red to blue and/or from the top of the page to the bottom of the page will increase click-through.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
How would you set up this test?<font class="jammer"></font><br />
<font class="jammer">. Waral dи,</font><br />
answers：This question is asked to weed out candidates that do not know the basics of AB testing and those that do. Also known as significance or split testing, it’s especially important when measuring a change in a feature release or configuration.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Let’s start out by explaining how we would first run the test to demonstrate our general knowledge of AB testing. In this case, the question is prompting multiple changes within the experiment design itself. A singular change would be a test of the button turning from red to blue. But the question also asks if moving the button from the top of the page to the bottom of the page will also make a difference. Due to the testing of two independent variables, we get a test that will give us an interaction effect of two different variables creating four variants.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Combinations:<font class="jammer">. 1point 3 acres</font><br />
1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Red button - Top of the page<font class="jammer"></font><br />
2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Red button - Bottom of the page<font class="jammer"></font><br />
3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue button - Top of the page<font class="jammer">. </font><br />
4.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blue button - Bottom of the page<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Our test is now multi-variate. One option that must be noted is that more test variants increase the variance of the results. One way to decrease these effects is to increase the length of time of the test until reaching significance to reduce variance from day-to-day effects.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Another possibility to note is that chaining the AB tests may also be a possibility but would remove the option of an interaction effect. In this scenario, chaining the AB tests would be running the color change test for a set amount of time and then running the top or bottom of the page test afterward. This would be a greedy version of running the test given that if the red button won and then the bottom of the page variant won, we wouldn’t have known if the interaction effect of blue + bottom of the page may have changed the outcome.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
Let’s make sure to add into the solution to note the general design of the AB test as well to not get caught up in the specifics of the multivariate testing. We need to calculate the sample size we would need by multiplying the number of users per day that would be bucketed in each variant by the number of days that it would take to reach significance. We also need to note that we would randomly bucket each user into each variant in order to not bias the results.<font class="jammer"></font><br />
